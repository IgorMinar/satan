Automated Process Reaper for Unix Systems

Satan does just one thing, and one thing only; kill processes. This is particularly useful for Solarisâ€™ SMF self-healing facility. Let Satan kill while SMF revives. The Satan name is a play off of the God Monitor http://god.rubyforge.org/ 

God overlaps too much in functionality with SMF where it is not practical to run on Solaris.

Features

  - No dependencies aside from Ruby
  - Email notification on reaped processes
  - Easy to use DSL to define reaping rules
  - HTTP checks to reap based on non-200 response code
  
INSTALLATION

  - Install satan on your run path: /opt/bin;/opt/sfw/bin;/usr/bin
  - Edit satan.smf to your liking and import: svccfg import satan.smf

HOW TO USE

  - /opt/bin/satan ~/satan.cfg
    OR
  - via SMF, see installation block.

The configuration is all done in Ruby, clean and simple.
