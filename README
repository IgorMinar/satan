Automated Process Reaper for Unix Systems

Satan does just one thing and one thing well, kill processes. This is useful for systems such as Solaris's SMF that can do self healing. Let Satan kill while SMF revives. The Satan name is a play off of the God Monitor http://god.rubyforge.org/ 

God overlaps too much in functionality with SMF where it is not practical to run on Solaris.

The configuration is all done in Ruby, clean and simple.

Satan.watch do |s|
  s.name = "jetty-instances"
  s.user = "webservd"
  s.group = "webservd"
  s.deamon = "java"
  s.args = "start.jar"
  s.debug = true
  s.interval = 2.seconds
  
  s.kill_if do |process|
    process.condition(:cpu) do |cpu|
      cpu.name = "50% CPU limit"
      cpu.above = 50.percent
      cpu.times = 5
    end
    
    process.condition(:memory) do |memory|
      memory.name = "512MB limit"
      memory.above = 512.megabytes
      memory.times = 5
    end
  end
end
